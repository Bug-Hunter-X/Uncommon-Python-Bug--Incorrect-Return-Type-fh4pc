This repository contains a demonstration of a common Python error involving incorrect return types in functions. The `bug.py` file shows the problematic code where the function is supposed to return an integer, but instead returns a value of a different type under specific conditions (not shown here for brevity). The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version of the function, enhancing type handling and error management to resolve this issue.  This is a minimal example to showcase the problem, and real-world scenarios might involve more complex return type handling.
